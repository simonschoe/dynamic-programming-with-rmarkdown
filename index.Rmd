## 1 The Story So Far: `R` Scripts

```{r, echo=F, out.width='70%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./img/r-script.PNG")
```

--

.center[
With R scripts (`.R`), a report of your analysis must be drawn separately from your code (e.g., in MS Word) while collecting all plots and results you have previously written to file (e.g., `.PNG` or `.csv`). More importantly, each change of the code requires a whole review of the report!
]

???
- file extension `.R`
- top right: see the name of the opened RStudio project
- explain the different panes
- a script is really just plain R code, maybe annotated by comments
- the code is executed by sending it from the editor pane to the console
- output is either shown in the console or in plot/viewer pane
- send the whole code to console or just chunks
- not really a good approach because you are going back and forth between console and script the whole time
- and what does this workflow look like if you have to write a report based on your code (e.g., your thesis)?

**The `rmarkdown` package:**

*Note: The different document elements apply to R Markdown Documents (`.Rmd`-files) and do not appear in common R Scripts (`.R`-files)*.
]

---

## 2 R Markdown Documents
### 2.1 The `YAML` Header

The **`YAML` header** appears at the top of each `.Rmd` document. It contains a bunch of metadata as well as formatting options for your final report. The syntax for the header is based on [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML).

```
 ---
 title: "Rmarkdown Demo"    # Title/headline of your markdown report
 author: John Doe           # Name of the author
 date: 2021-10-11           # Date of the report
 output:                    # YAML options specifying the output
   html_document:               # Output format
     toc: true                  # Table of contents (toc)
     toc_float: true            # Floating toc on the left side of the document
     toc_depth: 2               # Depth of headers to generate toc
 ---
```

Importantly, `.Rmd` can be converted to a plethora of different file formats, e.g., HTML, PDF, Word, even Powerpoint slides, by specifying the `output` argument.

.footnote[
*Note: For the various options of modifying the header of an HTML document see [Xie/Allaire/Grolemund (2021)](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html).*
]

???
YAML: "YAML Ain't Markup Language"
Only a small extract of options you can specify as part of the YAML header.

---

## 2 R Markdown Documents
### 2.2 The Text Body

In principal, `.Rmd`-documents allow you to format text in the same way as Microsoft Word would, only that you insert and format text using a special syntax: *markdown*.

## 2 R Markdown Documents
### 2.3 Code Chunks & Output

Code chunks are self-contained parts of `R` code for which, upon code evaluation, the output of your code is shown directly below the chunk instead of in your console, the RStudio *Viewer* pane or the *Plots* pane.

.pull-left[
````
```{r fibo}`r ''`
fib <- function(n) {
  x <- numeric(n)
  x[1:2] <- c(1, 1)
  for(i in 3:n) {
    x[i] <- x[i-1] + x[i-2]
  }
  return(x)
}

fib(10)
```
````
```{r, echo=F}
fib <- function(n) {
  x <- numeric(n)
  x[1:2] <- c(1, 1)
  for(i in 3:n) {
    x[i] <- x[i-1] + x[i-2]
  }
  return(x)
}

fib(10)
```
]
.pull-right[
- Create a new code chunks using the `Ctrl + Alt + I` keyboard shortcut (on Windows).
- Code chunks even allow you to write and evaluate code in other languages, such as Python, SQL or C++, depending on the computational engine (e.g., `{r}`).
- You can even insert code output dynamically into your text using inline code:  
The 5. element of the Fib series is `` `r fib(5)[5]` ``  
The 5. element of the Fib series is `r fib(5)[5]`
]

???
The code is send from the chunk to your console where it is evaluated. The output is then send back to your code chunk where it is displayed below.

Note:
- each chunk is surrounded by three tick-marks (at start and end)
- first word in curved bracket indicates computational engine
- second word gives a name to code chunks for referencing

## 2 R Markdown Documents
### 2.3 Code Chunks & Output

Chunk options are (mostly) set as boolean (**`T`**`rue`/**`F`**`alse`) arguments in the chunk header `{r ...}` to further customize the behavior of your code chunks when they are rednered to the final output format.

```{r, echo=F}
df <- data.frame(
  Argument = c('include=F', 'eval=F', 'results="hide"', 'echo=F', 'message=F', 'warning=F'),
  Description = c(
    'Code and Output do not appear in the final report (yet, code is still evaluated).',
    'Output does not appear in the final report as the code is not evaluated.',
    'Output does not appear in the final report but the code is evaluated.',
    'Code does not appear in the final report.',
    'Messages generated by the code do not appear in the final report.',
    'Warnings generated by the code do not appear in the final report.')
)

knitr::kable(df, format = "html", table.attr = "style='width:100%;'")
```

---

## 2 R Markdown Documents (`.Rmd`)
### 2.4 Generating High-Quality Reports

Render the `.Rmd` document into your desired output format by using the `rmarkdown::render()` command or hit the *Knit* button in your RStudio toolbar.

```{r, echo=F, out.height='50%', out.width='50%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/61d189fd9cdf955058415d3e1b28dd60e1bd7c9b/b739c/lesson-images/rmarkdownflow.png")
```

**Workflow in the background:**
1. `knitr` takes your `.Rmd`-file, executes the code chunks as well as inline code, and converts everything into plain markdown format (`.md`). If you have an error somewhere in your code, `knitr` will revolt!
2. The `.md`-file is processed by the document converter `pandoc` and converted into the final output format (e.g., PDF, HTML, Word).

.footnote[
*Note: For an intuitive distinction between `markdown`, `rmarkdown`, `knitr` and `pandoc` see this [stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/40563480).*
]

???
pandoc is a software tool itself which is installed along with `rmarkdown`

## 3 Interactive Data Science 
### 3.1 Introduction to Computational Notebooks

**Computational notebooks** are virtual interfaces used for [Literate Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming). They combine features of word processors (e.g., Microsoft Word) and the programming language kernel (e.g., the `R` shell which you find in the RStudio *Console* pane).

.pull-left[
**Features:**
- Interactivity
- Iteration
- Sharing & Communication
- Transparency
- Reproducibility

]]

???
Literate Programming:
- Writing human-readable computer programs
- Boils down to having the source code as well as natural language documentations in one file

Notebook Alternatives: Jupyter Notebook (language agnostic, but especially widespread in the Python area), R Notebook, Google Colab

### 3.1 Introduction to Computational Notebooks

```

## 3 Interactive Data Science 
### 3.2 R Markdown Documents vs. R Notebooks

Primarily, both formats are based on `.Rmd`-files. A notebook (in the `R` universe) can be viewed as a special version of an R Markdown document (it has a special way of executing the code included in the document).

.pull-left[
**R Markdown documents:**
```
 ---
 title: "R Markdown Document"
 author: John Doe
 date: "`r format(Sys.time(), '%d %B, %Y')`"
 output: html_document
 ---
```
- All code is executed when hitting the `Knit` button (batch execution).
- Hence, R Markdown documents require your code to be free of errors!
]
.pull-right[
**R Notebooks:**
```
 ---
 title: "R Markdown Notebook"
 author: John Doe
 date: "`r format(Sys.time(), '%d %B, %Y')`"
 output: html_notebook
 ---
```
- `Knit` is replaced by a `Preview` button.
- A self-contained HTML-snapshot of your R Markdown document is created whenever you save it or hit `Preview` (see `.nb.html`-file).
- No `R` code is executed - the preview is created as-is (including errors).
]

???
The use case is determined by your goal:
- generating high-quality reports with R Markdown documents
- doing interactive data science / machine learning using R Notebooks
